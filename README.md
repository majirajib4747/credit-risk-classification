# credit-risk-classification
This is Supervised machine learning challenge for UPenn Data Science Boot Camp. In this exercise 
First we had split the data set into Training and Test ( Test is 20%). 
Then used logistic regression model and measure the performance on test data. 
Then we had resampled training data and measured the performance 
For resampling we had to use scikit learn 1.2.2 instead of 1.3.0.
